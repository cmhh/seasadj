**Note.** This is very much a work in progress.  It hasn't been tested with particularly diverse inputs, and requires a fair few more unit tests, etc.  

## Overview

[X13-ARIMA-SEATS](https://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/x13down_unix.html) is a command-line program for the seasonal adjustment of time series data, written and maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau.  It is in widespread use, particularly among National Statistics Offices.  The main purpose of this library is to:

* provide a programmatic interface for running X13-ARIMA-SEATS
* provide a stateless microservice that can be used to run X13-ARIMA-SEATS remotely

The programmatic interface provides an abstraction that _may_ make it easier to use X13-ARIMA-SEATS in production pipelines and other workflows since there is no explicit use of the command line or filesystem, for example, and specifications can be built entirely programmatically.  Similarly for the microservice&ndash;in this case, any tool with an HTTP module can use the service, the only input required being a single JSON file.  The library was mainly written to support the creation of a JVM-based web service, however.

Of course, there are other incidental benefits provided here.  Specifically, being written in Scala, it is relatively easy to run adjustments concurrently, so large batch adjustments can be run faster.  Of course, under the hood X13-ARIMA-SEATS makes heavy use of physical files, so this is somewhat dependent on disk contention.

## Installation

The library is supplied as an [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) project.  To build a so-called fat jar, simply enter the project directory and run:

```bash
sbt assembly
```

This will yield a jar `target/scala-2.13/seasadj.jar` which contains everything required.  To use the library, simply include the jar file in your classpath.  To run the seasonal adjustment service, simply run:

```bash
java -cp seasadj.jar org.cmhh.seasadj.Service
```

And, of course, X13-ARIMA-SEATS itself must be present, and in the search path.  Specifically, the executable file `x13ashtml`.  This can be obtained from the following URL:

[https://www.census.gov/ts/x13as/unix/x13ashtmlall_V1.1_B39.tar.gz](https://www.census.gov/ts/x13as/unix/x13ashtmlall_V1.1_B39.tar.gz)

On a Linux platform, it is relatively easy to build X13-ARIMA-SEATS from source, and a utility script, [buildx13.sh](buildx13.sh), is provided which will do this, storing the resulting binary in `${HOME}/.local/bin`.

Alternatively, the service is easily containerised, and a simple example Dockerfile is included.  To build the container run:

```bash
docker-compose -f seasadj.yml build
```

N.b. this still assumes `sbt assembly` has been run, and `target/scala-2.13/seasadj.jar` exists.  There is an alternate Dockerfile, `docker/Dockerfile.alt` which will copy the source and compile as part of the build, but it will take a little while to build.  Either way, to run the service:

```bash
docker-compose -f seasadj.yml up -d
```

## Overview X13-ARIMA-SEATS

To adjust a single series, we generally prepare at minimum a so-called specification file with extension `spc`.  For example, the following file, which is generally distributed with the X13-ARIMA-SEATS binary, is a complete example:

~~~{#airlinespc caption="testairline.spc"}
series{
  title="International Airline Passengers Data from Box and Jenkins"
  start=1949.01
  data=(
    112 118 132 129 121 135 148 148 136 119 104 118

    145 150 178 163 172 178 199 199 184 162 146 166
    171 180 193 181 183 218 230 242 209 191 172 194

    242 233 267 269 270 315 364 347 312 274 237 278

}

automdl{  
  savelog=automodel  
}

x11{
  save=(d10 d11 d12)
}
~~~

The series could then be adjusted at the terminal by running:

```bash
x13ashtml testairline
```

Or, if we want to redirect the outputs:

```bash
x13ashtml -i testairline -o o/testairline
```

A metafile with extension `mta` can also be used to control input and output locations for an arbitrary number of input series.  In this case, in addition to the specification file we could create a metafile, `airline.mta`, as follows:

~~~{#airlinemta .bash caption="testairline.mta"}
<path>/testairline <path>/o/testairline
~~~

and we could then run the adjustment as follows:

```bash
x13ashtml -m testairline -s
```

Program output typically spans a number of individual files, saved in the same folder as the specification, or to a chosen output folder as indicated in the example above (the second entry on each line of a `mta` file).  The `-s` flag results in a file containing a range of summary measures and diagnostics being saved with a `udg` or `xdg` extension, depending whether an `X11` or `SEATS` adjustment specification is used.  The first few lines of the resulting `udg` file in this case look as follows:

~~~{#airlineudg caption="testairline.udg"}

...
~~~

Most other output is expressed as a time series.  For example, the seasonally adjusted series, if requested, is saved in a file with either a `d11` or `s11` extension, depending whether an `X11` or `SEATS` adjustment is conducted.  In the case of the above example, the file looks as follows:

~~~{#airlined11 caption="testairline.d11"}

## Seasonal Adjustment as a Service

The primary motivation here was to provide a simple wrapper for X13-ARIMA-SEATS, usable from any client with HTTP support.  Additionally, the adjustments themselves are completely stateless&ndash;we send data to the service, and the service responds with adjusted data, but the server does not retain either of the input or output.

### Adjusting a series

To adjust a series, we provide a JSON representation of our specification in the request body.  For example:

```bash
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @examples/airline/airline.json localhost:9001/seasadj/adjust \
  --compressed --output -
```

The output will be relatively large, while still being quite readable.  For example, the above will yield output laid out as follows:

```json
{
  "airline": {
    "series": {
      "ador": {...},
      "ao": {...},
      ...
      "trn": {...},
      "xtrm": {...}
    },
    "diagnostics": {...}
  }
}
```

`series` contains all of the output produced by X13-ARIMA-SEATS that is a valid time series, and can be univariate or multivariate.  For example, the trend series will look as follows:

```json
"trn": {
  "date": ["1952.01", "1952.02", ...,"1960.11", "1960.12"],
  "value": [190.982678228513, 188.515085239703,... , 489.755759131541, 491.11387257342]
}
```

while regression factors will look as follows:

```json
"fct": {
  "date":["1961.01", "1961.02", ..., "1961.11","1961.12"],
  "value":[
    [442.417804625906,418.958393743495,467.19081601655],
    [412.125296290046,381.626024600631,445.062047379767],
    ...
    [420.602564274142,351.208361194933,503.708159088486],
    [477.081007063438,395.206825653025,575.916893450857]
  ]
}
```

`diagnostics` is an object containing key-value pairs for each summary or diagnostic measure found in the usual `xdg`/`udg` file.  Some diagnostics will be parsed into numeric arrays, but many will be left as strings.  For example, if the result was stored as an object called `ap`:

```javascript
> ap["airline"]["diagnostics"]["f3.qm2"]
0.18
```

Note the date representation can be made more compact by adding a query parameter `/?allDates=false`, in which case dates are represented by just the starting date and frequency (so, while smaller, clients will have to do some work to restore the full sequence if needed for plotting, for example).  For example, `trn` now looks as follows:

```json
"trn": {
  "start": "1952.01", "period":12,
  "value":[190.982678228513, 188.515085239703, ..., 489.755759131541, 491.11387257342]
}
```

Finally, we can omit series we are not interested in by adding a query parameter, `save`, which takes a comma separated list of series.  For example, to include only the original (`ori`), trend (`trn`), and seasonally adjusted (`sa`) series, we'd add `/?save=ori,trn,sa`.  This reduces output size, but since each series must be read from a temporary file on the server, it also reduces the overall response time.  

### Batch adjustment

The adjustment service expects a JSON object, and that object can include any number of series&ndash;the earlier example just contained one.  But consider the following specification:

```json
{
  "memp": {
    "series": {
      "data": [953.8, 944.0, 936.2, 938.7, 946.1, 933.7, 931.1, 932.4, 915.8, 899.3, 879.3, 889.3, 879.3, 864.3, 858.9, 874.0, 869.6, 863.2, 856.6, 863.9, 852.6, 843.9, 832.4, 841.2, 845.7, 844.0, 835.1, 849.4, 854.0, 859.2, 856.7, 879.2, 881.9, 890.7, 896.2, 916.4, 929.6, 934.5, 936.7, 958.1, 957.7, 957.4, 959.4, 971.6, 967.8, 964.3, 960.7, 973.1, 966.6, 952.3, 944.0, 954.4, 958.7, 952.7, 955.9, 984.1, 979.3, 970.7, 976.6, 998.4, 997.4, 989.0, 998.8, 1019.2, 1036.2, 1027.8, 1027.3, 1048.0, 1050.2, 1045.5, 1055.9, 1072.2, 1081.2, 1088.0, 1091.2, 1121.3, 1114.6, 1106.5, 1118.8, 1141.1, 1139.8, 1141.8, 1139.5, 1161.1, 1158.5, 1155.4, 1157.5, 1170.3, 1150.3, 1154.4, 1145.2, 1172.5, 1141.5, 1142.6, 1116.1, 1137.2, 1139.5, 1133.4, 1145.3, 1150.8, 1155.7, 1149.2, 1151.4, 1161.6, 1162.1, 1148.8, 1135.7, 1141.5, 1157.0, 1156.8, 1169.4, 1198.5, 1208.1, 1213.4, 1212.6, 1242.5, 1254.6, 1253.8, 1240.0, 1270.7, 1283.8, 1311.7, 1323.9, 1348.9, 1370.0, 1359.5, 1378.5, 1399.9, 1404.5, 1401.2, 1406.8, 1410.0, 1418.0, 1414.3, 1421.3, 1442.4, 1457.8, 1446.6, 1437.3],

      "period": 4,
      "title": "femp",
      "comptype": "add",
      "start": 1986.01,
      "save": ["b1"]
    },
    "x11": {
      "mode": "mult",
      "sigmalim": [1.8, 2.8],
      "print": ["default", "f3", "qstat"],
      "save": ["c17", "d8", "d9", "d10", "d11", "d12", "d13"]
    }
  },
  "emp": {
    "composite": {
      "title": "'emp'"
    },
    "x11": {
      "mode": "mult",
      "sigmalim": [1.8, 2.8],
      "print": ["default", "f3", "qstat"],
      "save": ["c17", "d8", "d9", "d10", "d11", "d12", "d13"]
    }
  }
}
```

This is a valid input containing 3 series, one of which is a composite (that is, the last of the 3 is a series implicitly defined by adding the first two), and the service will handle this just fine.

### Creating and validating inputs 

The service provides several endpoints that can be useful when working with specifications.  Specifically:

endpoint                     | function
-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------
`/seasadj/spec/validateSPC`  | Confirm if a text string is valid as a traditional SPC file or not.
`/seasadj/spec/validateJSON` | Confirm if a text string is valid as a JSON specification or not.
`/seasadj/spec/toJSON/:name` | Convert a SPC text string to a valid JSON specification.
`/seasadj/spec/toSPC`        | Convert a JSON specification to JSON object with several SPC text strings.

To test if the content of a SPC file is valid, we pass it to the `/seasadj/spec/validateSPC` endpoint.  A response code of 200 should be returned with an appropriate message:

![](img/validatespc01.png)

![](img/validatespc02.png)

Similarly, to test a JSON string is a valid specification object we can use the `/seasadj/spec/validateJSON` endpoint:

![](img/validatejson01.png)

We can convert the content of a single SPC file to JSON via the `/seasadj/spec/toJSON/:name` endpoint:

![](img/tojson01.png)

In this case, failure will yield a status code of 422 (Unprocessable Entity) if the provided SPC appears invalid, and 500 (Internal Server Error) if the adjustment otherwise fails.  

Finally, we can convert a JSON specifications object via the `/seasadj/spec/toSPC` endpoint.  In this case the output will be a JSON object containing content appropriate for a SPC file for each individual specification found:

## Programmatic Interface

As noted above, the intention of the library is to provide a seasonal adjustment service, but it is also possible to perform adjustments entirely programmatically.  By way of an example, let us consider again the Box and Jenkins airline data.  This is bundled with the library as a bespoke `TimeSeries` object as follows:

```scala

The `airpassengers` object is of type `TimeSeries`, and has methods useful for working with seasonal adjustment specifications.  So consider the following complete specification:

```plaintext
series{
  title="International Airline Passengers Data from Box and Jenkins"
  start=1949.01
  data=(112 118 132 129 121 ... ... 606 508 461 390 432)
  span=(1952.01, )
}

x11{}
```

We can emulate this in an entirely programmatically as follows:

```scala
val s: Specs = 
  Map(
    ("series" ->
      Map(
        ("title" -> SpecString("International Airline Passengers Data from Box and Jenkins")),
        ("start" -> SpecDate(airpassengers.start)),
        ("data" -> airpassengers.toSpecValue._1),
        ("span" -> SpecSpan(Month(1952, 1)))
      )
    ),
    ("x11" -> Map.empty)
  )

val ap: Specification = Specification("airpassengers", s)
```

And to confirm this is the same:

```scala
scala> println(ap)
series {
  title="International Airline Passengers Data from Box and Jenkins"
  start=1949.01
  data=(112.0, 118.0, 132.0, 129.0, 121.0, 135.0, 148.0, 148.0,
        136.0, 119.0, 104.0, 118.0, 115.0, 126.0, 141.0, 135.0,
        125.0, 149.0, 170.0, 170.0, 158.0, 133.0, 114.0, 140.0,
        145.0, 150.0, 178.0, 163.0, 172.0, 178.0, 199.0, 199.0,
        184.0, 162.0, 146.0, 166.0, 171.0, 180.0, 193.0, 181.0,
        183.0, 218.0, 230.0, 242.0, 209.0, 191.0, 172.0, 194.0,
        196.0, 196.0, 236.0, 235.0, 229.0, 243.0, 264.0, 272.0,
        237.0, 211.0, 180.0, 201.0, 204.0, 188.0, 235.0, 227.0,
        234.0, 264.0, 302.0, 293.0, 259.0, 229.0, 203.0, 229.0,
        242.0, 233.0, 267.0, 269.0, 270.0, 315.0, 364.0, 347.0,
        312.0, 274.0, 237.0, 278.0, 284.0, 277.0, 317.0, 313.0,
        318.0, 374.0, 413.0, 405.0, 355.0, 306.0, 271.0, 306.0,
        315.0, 301.0, 356.0, 348.0, 355.0, 422.0, 465.0, 467.0,
        404.0, 347.0, 305.0, 336.0, 340.0, 318.0, 362.0, 348.0,
        363.0, 435.0, 491.0, 505.0, 404.0, 359.0, 310.0, 337.0,
        360.0, 342.0, 406.0, 396.0, 420.0, 472.0, 548.0, 559.0,
        463.0, 407.0, 362.0, 405.0, 417.0, 391.0, 419.0, 461.0,
        472.0, 535.0, 622.0, 606.0, 508.0, 461.0, 390.0, 432.0)
  span=(1952.01, )
}
x11 {}
```

This way of constructing specifications can become cumbersome in practice, and other methods are possible.  For example, something like a builder pattern can be used as follows:

```scala
val ap = Specification("airpassengers")
  .setParameter("International Airline Passengers Data from Box and Jenkins", "title", "series")
  .setParameter(SpecDate(airpassengers.start), "start", "series")
  .setParameter(airpassengers.toSpecValue._1, "data", "series")
  .setParameter(SpecSpan(Month(1952, 1)), "span", "series")
  .setSpec("x11")
```

As a further abstraction, there are also helpers for constructing the individual parameter values.  For example:

```scala
SpecSpan.fromString("(1952.01,)")
```

is equivalent to 

```scala
SpecSpan(Month(1952, 1))
```

Finally, we could also simply import a specification from a file on disk.  For example, assuming the airline spec was saved in a file called `testairline.spc`, we could simply run:

```scala
Specification.fromFile("airpassengers", "testairline.spc")
```

We can then adjust the series as follows:

```scala
val res: Try[Adjustment] = Adjustor.adjust(ap)
```

An `Adjustment` object consists of two maps: `series` containing all time series components, and `diagnostics` containing all diagnostic measures.  So, for example, to extract the seasonally adjusted series:

```scala
scala> res.foreach(r => println(r.getSeries("sa")))
              jan          feb          mar          apr          may          jun          jul          aug          sep          oct          nov          dec

and to look at the f3.q measure (which is a summary of overall adjustment quality, a value under one denoting an acceptable adjustment):

```scala
scala> res.foreach(r => println(r.getDiagnostic("f3.q")))
```
```plaintext
0.22
```

## Library Details

Internally, the whole specification is modelled as a single class called `Specification`.  A `Specification` in turn is a data class consisting of a name and then nested maps containing the individual groups of parameters.  In the case above, the name might be something like `airpassengers`, and the map member would contain the keys `series` and `x11`.  The value for `series` would be another map containing keys `title`, `start`, `data`, and `span`.  The value for `x11` would simply be an empty mapping.

The values themselves are all descended from an abstract class called `SpecValue`.  For example, in `start=1949.01`, `1949.01` is imported with type `SpecDate`.  Similarly, the right-hand side of the `data` argument is imported with type `SpecNumArray`, and `span` is imported with type `SpecSpan`.  Only certain types are permitted for certain parameters, and there is _some_ checking of correctness when constructing a `Specification`.  The validation is probably a little clumsy in its design, and is not complete.

Multiple specifications can be collected together to enable batch adjustments.  This is modelled as a single class called `Specifications` containing a single member, `specifications`, which is just a sequence of objects of type `Specification`.


### Mapping X13-ARIMA-SEATS Inputs

Consider the case where we wish to adjust two series: male and female employment; as well as indirectly adjusting total employment by way of a 'composite' adjustment.  We denote the three series in short as `memp`, `femp`, and `emp`, respectively.  The relevant specifications are as follows:

~~~{#mempspc caption="memp.spc"}
series{
  title="male employed"
  save=(b1)
  comptype=add
  data=(
    1206.7  1210.2  1208.6  1236.8
    1246.2  1244.2  1228.7  1258.3
    1270.5  1296.4  1307.7  1332.4)
  start=2014.01
  period=4
}

x11{
  mode=mult
  sigmalim=(1.8,2.8)
  save=(d8 d10 d11 d12 d13 c17)
}
~~~

~~~{#fempspc caption="femp.spc"}
series{
  title="female employed"
  save=(b1)
  comptype=add
  data=(
    1080.3  1071.4  1088    1119.3
    1114.8  1105.1  1100.7  1130
    1138.5  1157.9  1164.3  1194.5)
  start=2014.01
  period=4
}

x11{
  mode=mult
  sigmalim=(1.8,2.8)
  save=(d8 d10 d11 d12 d13 c17)
}
~~~

~~~{#empspc caption="emp.spc"}
composite{
  title="total employed"
  save=(isf isa itn b1 id8 iir)
}

x11{
  mode=add
  sigmalim=(1.8, 2.8)
  save=(e1 c17 d8 d9 d10 d11 d12 d13)
}
~~~

Finally, to run this in such a way that the total employed series, `emp`, is adjusted indirectly as the sum of male and female employment, we would require that the three series be adjusted together by using a metafile as follows:

~~~{#empmta caption="employment.mta"}
<path to spc>/memp <path to output>/memp
<path to spc>/femp <path to output>/femp
<path to spc>/emp  <path to output>/emp
~~~

For no other reason than JSON is seemingly near-universal in its use in web services, we create a service that accepts a single JSON string as input, and returns output as JSON also.  Of course, we can express an adjustment in this format without any loss of functionality, and we hope that the example given is general enough to convince us this is true.  At any rate, it should be clear that the following JSON representation is sufficient to represent the stated setup:

```json
{
  "memp": {
    "series": {
      "title": "male employed",
      "start": 2014.1,
      "period": 4,
      "data": [
        1206.7, 1210.2, 1208.6, 1236.8, 
        1246.2, 1244.2, 1228.7, 1258.3, 
        1270.5, 1296.4, 1307.7, 1332.4],
      "comptype": "add"
    },
    "x11": {
      "mode": "mult",
      "sigmalim": [1.8, 2.8]
    }
  },
  "femp": {
    "series": {
      "title": "male employed",
      "start": 2014.1,
      "period": 4,
      "data": [
        1080.3, 1071.4, 1088.0, 1119.3, 
        1114.8, 1105.1, 1100.7, 1130.0, 
        1138.5, 1157.9, 1164.3, 1194.5],
      "comptype": "add"
    },
    "x11": {
      "mode": "mult",
      "sigmalim": [1.8, 2.8]
    }
  },
  "emp": {
    "composite": {
      "title": "total employment"
    },
    "x11": {
      "mode": "mult",
      "sigmalim": [1.8, 2.8]
    }
  }
}
```

Here, we account for the metafile by including the series in the array in the same order.  We do not need the path information for the purpose of calling the service, though internally the service will handle this for us.  This will prove far more convenient in practice than the traditional setup&ndash;we have traded 4 files here for a single JSON file / string.  Actually, the rationalisation can be greater still.  It is not uncommon to provide the time series data for each series in separate files, and the path to the data as a parameter in the specification.  In this case, we would have had 6 input files (we do not need to provide data for composites).  In our case, we will require that the data always be present in the specification, and we forbid the use of separate files and paths.

### Mapping X13-ARIMA-SEATS Outputs

Internally, all adjustments are run with the `-g` flag, which means most tables are saved, as well as ensuring that diagnostics are written to an `xdg` or `udg` file.  Currently, the result of an adjustment is stored in a case class called `Adjustment` which has members `series` and `diagnostics`.  `series` is a collection containing all output that can be imported as a `TimeSeries` (irregular component, seasonally adjusted series, trend, etc.), while `diagnostics` is a hashmap containing all the measures found in the `xdg` or `udg` files&ndash;values are stored as numeric or integer scalars or arrays if possible, and strings otherwise.

### A comment on the the use of files

X13-ARIMA-SEATS specifications often refer to files on disk.  For example, assume the airline data was saved in a file called `airline.dat` as follows:

```plaintext
1949 1 112
1949 2 118
1949 3 132
1949 4 129
...
```

then we could adjust via a specification that looks as follows:

```
series{
  title="International Airline Passengers Data from Box and Jenkins"
  file="d/airline.dat"
  span=(1952.01, )
}

x11{}
```

As long as this path name is resolved correctly by the running program, this would work.  However, at least as far as a running web service goes, we wish to shield users from such details, and we instead favour the approach where specifications are self-contained, with no reference to files on disk.  

The library does provide facilities for 'correcting' such inputs.  Given a specification, we can use the `resolveFiles` method to replace all `file` parameters with `data` and `start` as appropriate.  So, assuming we have the spec above, and _somewhere_ inside the folder `/foo/bar` we have a file ending with `d/airline.dat`, then we could run:

```scala
val ap2 = ap.resolveFiles("/foo/bar")
```

Since specifications are immutable, this would leave `ap` unchanged, but return a new specification, `ap2`, with content:

```plaintext
series {
  title="International Airline Passengers Data from Box and Jenkins"
  start=1949.01
  data=(112.0, 118.0, 132.0, 129.0, 121.0, 135.0, 148.0, 148.0,
        136.0, 119.0, 104.0, 118.0, 115.0, 126.0, 141.0, 135.0,
        125.0, 149.0, 170.0, 170.0, 158.0, 133.0, 114.0, 140.0,
        145.0, 150.0, 178.0, 163.0, 172.0, 178.0, 199.0, 199.0,
        184.0, 162.0, 146.0, 166.0, 171.0, 180.0, 193.0, 181.0,
        183.0, 218.0, 230.0, 242.0, 209.0, 191.0, 172.0, 194.0,
        196.0, 196.0, 236.0, 235.0, 229.0, 243.0, 264.0, 272.0,
        237.0, 211.0, 180.0, 201.0, 204.0, 188.0, 235.0, 227.0,
        234.0, 264.0, 302.0, 293.0, 259.0, 229.0, 203.0, 229.0,
        242.0, 233.0, 267.0, 269.0, 270.0, 315.0, 364.0, 347.0,
        312.0, 274.0, 237.0, 278.0, 284.0, 277.0, 317.0, 313.0,
        318.0, 374.0, 413.0, 405.0, 355.0, 306.0, 271.0, 306.0,
        315.0, 301.0, 356.0, 348.0, 355.0, 422.0, 465.0, 467.0,
        404.0, 347.0, 305.0, 336.0, 340.0, 318.0, 362.0, 348.0,
        363.0, 435.0, 491.0, 505.0, 404.0, 359.0, 310.0, 337.0,
        360.0, 342.0, 406.0, 396.0, 420.0, 472.0, 548.0, 559.0,
        463.0, 407.0, 362.0, 405.0, 417.0, 391.0, 419.0, 461.0,
        472.0, 535.0, 622.0, 606.0, 508.0, 461.0, 390.0, 432.0)
  span=(1952.01, )
}
x11 {}
```

## Additional Examples

In this section, we include further examples of programmatic use in Scala.

### Importing a JSON file

A JSON file can contain one or more potential adjustments, and so JSON files will generally be imported as `Specifications`&ndash;there is no problem creating an object of type `Specifications` that contains just a single series.  To import and adjust a JSON file:

```scala
val foo: Try[Specifications] = Specifications.fromJSON("foo.json")
val bar: Try[Adjustments] = foo.flatMap(Adjustor.adjust(foo))
```

If uncomfortable with the use of `Try` (and if absolutely sure of a positive outcome), one could instead do something like:

```scala
val foo: Specifications = Specifications.fromJSON("foo.json").get
val bar: Adjustments = Adjustor.adjust(foo).get
```

### Importing a working folder (`spc` and `mta` files)

A common way of working with X13-ARIMA-SEATS is to store a collection of time series and specifications in a single working directory, and run a batch adjustment using a `mta` file.  While it probably isn't practical to anticipate every possible setup, a simple utility is provided which will import the contents of a working directory and output a single JSON file for each `mta` file contained therein, provided the following conditions are met:

* there is one or more `mta` files in the root directory
* there is one or more `spc` files in the root directory
* all files referenced in the `spc` files are somewhere below the root directory.

Given such a setup, one can then run:

```bash
java -cp seasadj.jar org.cmhh.seasadj.tools.ImportInputs <input path> <output path>
```

Files will be matched up with `file` parameters in `spc` files as closely as possible (i.e. even if the full path does not match exactly), and the `file` parameters will generally be replaced with `data` parameters.  Essentially all files below root are recursively listed, the best match for a file referred to in a spec is the file with the longest matching sequence of characters from the end working backwards.

As an example, the `examples/hlfsemp` folder contains the following:

```plaintext
examples/hlfsemp
├── d
│   ├── femp.dat
│   └── memp.dat
├── emp.mta
├── emp.spc
├── femp.spc
└── memp.spc
```

`femp.spc` and `memp.spc` are both relatively simple, and each includes reference to an external file containing data.  For example, `femp.spc` is as follows:

```plaintext
series {
  start=1986.1
  period=4
  title='femp'
  file='d/femp.dat'
  save=(b1)
  format='datevalue'
  comptype=add
}
 
x11 {
  mode=mult
  sigmalim=(1.8,2.8)
  print=(default f3 qstat)
  save=(c17 d8 d9 d10 d11 d12 d13)
}
```

and `examples/hlfsemp/d/femp.dat` looks as follows (note the underlying library doesn't handle all possible date formats as yet):

```plaintext
1986 3 672.2
1986 6 671.7
1986 9 674.3
1986 12 682.8
...
2019 12 1284.2
2020 3 1287.6
2020 6 1273
2020 9 1263.3
```

`emp.spc` is a simple composite:

```plaintext
composite {
  title='emp'
}

x11 {
  mode=mult
  sigmalim=(1.8,2.8)
  print=(default f3 qstat)
  save=(c17 d8 d9 d10 d11 d12 d13)
}
```

and all three series can be adjusted using the provided `emp.mta` file:

```plaintext
memp o/memp
femp o/femp
emp o/emp
```

To import this complete setup, we run:

```bash
java -cp seasadj.jar org.cmhh.seasadj.tools.ImportInputs examples/hlfsemp examples/hlfsemp
```

We'll get one JSON file for each `mta` file.  In this case there is just `emp.mta`, so we get `emp.json`, output to `examples/hlfsemp`.  The file is not formatted, but formatted, the results are:

```json

### Adjustment templates

Another approach one might take when adjusting series is to create functions that take a `TimeSeries` as input, and return `Specifications`.  Vanilla X11 and SEATS methods are provided for demonstrative purposes (and, of course, the builder pattern can still be used with such objects).  For example, to do a SEATS-style adjustment of the Box and Jenkins airline data:

```scala
val ap = Specification.Seats("airpassengers", data.airpassengers)
```

The full definition of the `Seats` method is as follows:

```scala
  /**
   * Create a basic [[Specification]] from a [[TimeSeries]]&ndash;SEATS variant.
   *
   * @param name name
   * @param data time series
   */
  def Seats(name: String, data: TimeSeries): Specification = {
    val (seriesData, seriesStart) = data.toSpecValue
    val seriesSpec: Spec = Map(
      "title" -> SpecString(name), 
      "data" -> seriesData, 
      "start" -> seriesStart
    )
    Specification(
      name,
      Map("series" -> seriesSpec, "seats" -> Map[String,SpecValue]())
    )
  }
```
